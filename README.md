# Pokedex

This is a web-based Pokedex application built with Angular 17 and GraphQL.

It consumes the [pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co) API.

User is able to navigate and search through all Pokemons and view their basic statistics.
User is able to capture and release Pokemons. Random Pokemons are put as "captured" on the first load and stay in the cache for a week to simulate a user account.
